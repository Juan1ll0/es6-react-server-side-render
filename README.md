es6-react-server-side-render
----------------------------

A simple example of how to do server-side rendering (ES6) with the
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library so that component code can be
shared between server and browser, as well as getting fast initial page loads
and search-engine-friendly pages.

Technologies:
  - React
  - Webpack (front & back)
  - Node
  - Express
  - Babel
  - ES6 (front & back)
  - React Router
  - Jade

Examples:
  - pureReact: Small App without any template engine, only React.
  - pureWithRouter: Simple App without any template engine, only React and react router.
  - withJade: Easy App with Jade template engine for react compoments and static files.
  - withJadeFlux: App with Jade template engine and Flux architecture.
